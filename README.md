# Spotify-Inspired React App

Welcome to my first React project! ðŸŽ‰ This is a simple Spotify-inspired page where users can explore artists and their genres. It includes features like:

- Artist search functionality.
- Displaying artist images and names.
- A clean, responsive design inspired by Spotify's UI.

## Features

- **Search for artists**: As you type in the search bar, it will query a mock API and display artist results dynamically.
- **Artist cards**: Each artist is displayed in a card format with their name, genre, and an image.
- **Responsive layout**: The app is designed to look great on both desktop and mobile.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The core library used to build this app.
- **CSS**: For styling the page with custom designs and animations.
- **Fetch API**: Used to fetch mock data from a local JSON file (could be replaced with a real API in the future).
